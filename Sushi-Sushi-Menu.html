                        <p>Chirashi Sushi, or "Scattered Sushi", came on the horizon along with Maki Sushi (rolled sushi) around the 18th century. Another close translation for it is "sushi rice salad"; just to give you another idea for the basic original Japanese meaning of the word.</p>

                        <p>And in general it is like a sushi salad. The ingredients (or "gu") are scattered or topped on sushi rice with no rolling or shaping involved. A no muss, no fuss type of Sushi perfect for families and quick at home preparation, and also a convenient dish to make use of leftovers that may be available. Serving is a snap too, as it can be served in individual bowls or it can be placed in a single large bowl where everybody can spoon out what they want into their own serving bowl.</p>

                    <p>Inari sushi is made by filling a pouch of seasoned fried tofu (abura age)  with Sushi Rice. It is named after the Shinto god, Inari who is said to have had a fondness for tofu.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is also said that the Japanese were the first to develop tofu pouches but little is really known of the early history. There is mention of a deep fried tofu recipe in Todu Hyakuchin which was a Japanese recipe book written and published in 1782 during the Edo period. And it is also known that Inari-Zushi was created in 1853. </p>

                        <p>Maki Sushi or the Sushi Roll is one of the most popular types of sushi in America. To see evidence of this all you have to do is walk into any well-stocked modern grocery store and usually you can find a Sushi booth stuffed with all kinds of variations of Maki rolls. </p>
                    
                        <p>Many times that Sushi booth will even be manned with an oriental looking guy (we all look alike, yes?) ready to take your order and make anything and everything that your little heart desires.</p>

                        <p>How far Sushi has come to make it into mainstream America like that. </p>

                        <p>Once prepared it should be eaten as soon as possible since the nori quickly absorbs moisture from the rice and can become soggy. Also, if left too long, the rice expands and can actually split the nori.</p>

                        <p>Narezushi (熟れ寿司, "matured sushi") is a traditional form of fermented sushi. Skinned and gutted fish are stuffed with salt, placed in a wooden barrel, doused with salt again, then weighed down with a heavy tsukemonoishi (pickling stone). As days pass, water seeps out and is removed. After six months, this sushi can be eaten, remaining edible for another six months or more. The most famous variety of narezushi still being produced is funa-zushi (made from fish of the crucian carp genus, authentically from C. auratus grandoculis (nigoro-buna) endemic to Lake Biwa), a typical dish of Shiga Prefecture.</p>

                <h2>Our favourites made for you</h2>
                <h3>Regular Nigiri</h3>
                <p>For most fish, nigiri sushi will be prepared the normal way, with the sliced fish on top of the rice. This is most common for neta such as maguro (tuna), toro (fatty tuna), sake (salmon), hamachi (yellowtail) and so forth. </p>
                
                <h3>Gunkan Maki</h3>
                <p>Many debate as to whether this is considered a maki-sushi or a nigiri, because there the word “maki” is in the name. However, gunkan maki is normally associated with nigiri sushi because the shari (sushi rice) ball is used as the base and it is prepared individually. Gunkan maki is a nigiri sushi that is surrounded by a sheet of nori (dried seaweed) to make it into a bowl-like casing. Gunkan maki is mostly used with neta that may fall apart or is scattered, such as uni (sea urchin), negi-toro (minced fatty tuna with scallions), ikura (salmon roe), masago (smelt roe), and tobiko (flying fish roe).</p>
                
                <h3>Nori Ribbon</h3>
                <p>While there isn’t an official name for this, like the toppings on some nigiri sushi, sometimes you’ll also see a thin strip of nori wrapped around the nigiri sushi. This is done for neta that lacks moisture and will not stick to the bed of rice. Neta such as tako (octopus), mirugai (geoduck clam), aoyagi (round clam), and tamago (egg) are some of the nigiri that may have the nori ribbon wrapped around it to keep it from falling off.</p>

                        <p>Oshi Sushi or Oshizushi is a type of sushi from Osaka, a part of the Kansai region. It means "pressed sushi" or is also called "box sushi".</p>
                        
                        <p>This is one of the oldest forms of sushi and stems from the ancient method of preserving fish by packing it tightly in boxes with fermented rice.</p>
                        
                        <p>Today, pressed sushi made with sushi rice and mackerel is one of the most popular forms of take out food bought at airports by Japanese travelers.</p>

                        <p>The Oshibako is used by alternating layers of sushi rice, condiments, and toppings which are then pressed with a wooden top in between each layer. The final layer of toppings is pressed and then the compact sushi block is sliced using the grooves visible in the sides of the box above.</p>
