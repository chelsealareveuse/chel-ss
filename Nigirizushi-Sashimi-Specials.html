                <h3>Regular Nigiri</h3>
                <p>For most fish, nigiri sushi will be prepared the normal way, with the sliced fish on top of the rice. This is most common for neta such as maguro (tuna), toro (fatty tuna), sake (salmon), hamachi (yellowtail) and so forth. </p>
                
                <h3>Gunkan Maki</h3>
                <p>Many debate as to whether this is considered a maki-sushi or a nigiri, because there the word “maki” is in the name. However, gunkan maki is normally associated with nigiri sushi because the shari (sushi rice) ball is used as the base and it is prepared individually. Gunkan maki is a nigiri sushi that is surrounded by a sheet of nori (dried seaweed) to make it into a bowl-like casing. Gunkan maki is mostly used with neta that may fall apart or is scattered, such as uni (sea urchin), negi-toro (minced fatty tuna with scallions), ikura (salmon roe), masago (smelt roe), and tobiko (flying fish roe).</p>
                
                <h3>Nori Ribbon</h3>
                <p>While there isn’t an official name for this, like the toppings on some nigiri sushi, sometimes you’ll also see a thin strip of nori wrapped around the nigiri sushi. This is done for neta that lacks moisture and will not stick to the bed of rice. Neta such as tako (octopus), mirugai (geoduck clam), aoyagi (round clam), and tamago (egg) are some of the nigiri that may have the nori ribbon wrapped around it to keep it from falling off.</p>
